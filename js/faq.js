    "question": "... isn't he a socialist?",
    "answer": 
        "Bernie Sanders is a <a href='http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/aug/26/bernie-sanders-socialist-or-democratic-socialist/'><i>democratic socialist</i></a> . In essence, he believes that our current economic system doesn't do enough to help poor and middle-class Americans and that democratic change is needed to create a more fair and just system.<br><br>" + 
        "But this isn't radical or scary! Many of the programs instituted by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson that we take for granted today &mdash; such as Medicare, the 40-hour work week, and the minimum wage &mdash; <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/bernie-sanders-makes-his-pitch-for-socialism/416913/'>can be considered socialist programs</a> ."

    "question": "... I heard he wants to raise taxes!",
    "answer": 
        "If you're one of the 1.5% of Americans making more than $231,450 a year, your <i>marginal</i> tax rate will go up slightly &mdash; money you earn above $231,450 will be taxed at 37% instead of 33%.<br><br>" +
        "If you're one of the 0.6% of Americans making more than $500,000 a year, your marginal rate will go up from 39.6% to 43%. Above $2,000,000 the rate will be 48%, and above $10,000,000 the rate will be 52%. These are tax increases that will only affect the very, <i>very</i> wealthy.<br><br>" +
        "On the other hand, the vast majority of Americans <a href='http://datatitian.com/bernie-tax/'>will see significant savings</a> when factoring in tax and healthcare changes under Bernie's plans."

    "question": "... is he even electable?",
    "answer": 
        "Absolutely. Bernie probably has a better chance in the general election than Hillary would have:<br><br>" +
        "Bernie performs better than Hillary does in all hypothetical match-ups against Republicans in <a href='http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_presidential_race.html'>poll after poll</a> (2.4% better against Trump, 4.6% better against Cruz, and 1.5% better against Rubio, on average).<br><br>" +
        "Bernie significantly outperforms Hillary in <a href='http://ivn.us/2015/09/15/ivn-presidential-poll-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-ben-carson-lead/'>surveys of <i>independent voters</i></a>, and with 30-40% of Americans identifying as independents, they will play the deciding role in the general election.<br><br>" +
        "And Bernie has a big lead in favorability, with a <a href='http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/bernie-sanders-favorable-rating'><b>+10%</b> net favorability</a> rating among all Americans, compared to <a href='http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/hillary-clinton-favorable-rating'>Hillary's <b>-10%</b> net favorability rating</a>. <b>No</b> presidential candidate has <a href='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bBLIXEsM56U/VoRD8zsEUlI/AAAAAAABxjs/CAnZZGXpO7M/w874-h894-no/OIusBY8.jpg'><b>ever</b> won with a negative favorability rating</a>."

    "question": "... how could he get anything done with a Republican Congress?",
    "answer": 
        "Bernie is actually well-known for his ability to compromise to get things done without sacrificing his values. In the House, he was known as the Amendment King, and passed more amendments &mdash; <a href='http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/6/1428616/-Bernie-Sanders-What-the-Hell-Have-You-Done-for-Us-Lately'>addressing exclusively progressive goals</a> &mdash; <a href='http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/bernie-gets-it-done-sanders-record-pushing-through-major-reforms-will-surprise-you'>than any other legislator</a>, by forging cross-party coalitions.<br><br>" + 
        "He has <a href='http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/71225/bernie-sanders-is-loud-stubborn-socialist-republicans-like-him-anyway'>earned respect from Republicans</a> ranging from <a href='http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/mccain-calls-sanders-x-rated-but-an-honest-man/article/2577874'>John McCain</a> to the ultra-conservative <a href='http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-bernie-sanders-fundraising/'>Jim Inhofe</a>. If any Democratic president can reach across the aisle to work with a stubborn Republican Congress, it's Bernie Sanders."

    "question": "... isn't he too weak on gun control?",
    "answer": 
        "Hardly &mdash; he has a <a href='http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/20/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-nra-report-card-d-minus-most-recent/'>D- rating</a> from the NRA and <a href='http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/27110/bernie-sanders/37'>consistent high ratings</a> from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.<br><br>" +
        "His position is that <a href='http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/255741-sanders-sees-consensus-for-serious-gun-control'>a broad consensus of common-sense gun control measures</a> is possible if neither side is alienated through overly divisive rhetoric."
},{
    "question": "... I heard he wants to get rid of Obamacare!",
    "answer":
        "Bernie wants to <i>expand</i> health care coverage, not get rid of it!<br><br>" +
        "Obamacare has made things a lot better, but it's only a step in the right direction: Americans are still <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/us-healthcare-most-expensive-and-worst-performing/372828/'>paying more for healthcare than any other country</a>, and <b>more than 10%</b> of us still don't have health insurance.<br><br>" +
        "Bernie's <a href='https://berniesanders.com/medicareforall/'>Medicare-for-all</a> proposal will do just what it says &mdash; provide coverage for every American citizen, while saving the average American family $2000&mdash;$4000 per year. <a href='http://berniecare.org/'>[Try the calculator!]</a>"
},{
    "question": "... does he have any experience with foreign policy?",
    "answer": "While Bernie's main focus is on domestic issues, he has shown remarkable foresight when it comes to foreign policy decisions. He was a member of a small minority voting against the invasion of Iraq in 2003, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdFw1btbkLM'>making an impassioned speech</a> arguing that overthrowing Saddam Hussein would result in a &quot;disaster&quot;. He was right."
},{
    "question": "... how will he pay for all this?",
    "answer": "Every dollar in Bernie Sanders's proposals is matched by a corresponding dollar raised in revenue &mdash; <a href='https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-bernie-pays-for-his-proposals/'>it's all accounted for</a>. For example, the $75 billion/year College For All plan will be paid for by a <a href='http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/ftt/Pollin--Heintz--Memo_on_FTT_Rates_and_Revenue_Potential_w_references----6-9-12.pdf'>tax on Wall Street speculation</a>, while the $100 billion/year Rebuild America Act will be paid for by <a href='http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40623.pdf'>taxing corporate offshore income</a>."
