    "answer": 
        "Bernie Sanders is a <a href='http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/aug/26/bernie-sanders-socialist-or-democratic-socialist/'><i>democratic socialist</i></a> . In essence, he believes that our current economic system doesn't do enough to help poor and middle-class Americans and that democratic change is needed to create a more fair and just system.<br><br>" + 
        "But this isn't radical or scary! Many of the programs instituted by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson that we take for granted today &mdash; such as Medicare, the 40-hour work week, and the minimum wage &mdash; <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/bernie-sanders-makes-his-pitch-for-socialism/416913/'>can be considered socialist programs</a> ."

    "question": "... I heard he wants to raise taxes!",
    "answer": 
        "This is technically true, but misleading. If you're paying $5,000 a year for health insurance today and you're in the middle class, Bernie's healthcare plan will save you $2000&mdash;$4000 per year. <a href='http://berniecare.org/'>[Try the calculator]</a> Imagine never having to pay insurance premiums again!<br><br>" +
        "Bernie's tax plan <i>will</i> increase taxes on the very wealthy, but your marginal tax rate will only go up if you're making more than $231,450 a year, and the tax hike will only be significant if you're making more than $2,000,000 a year. <a href='http://datatitian.com/bernie-tax/'>Most Americans will see significant savings</a> ."
